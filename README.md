#PhotoRoom

PhotoRoom is a fork of Snapdrop, currently this is a work in progress 

PhotoRoom is intended the solve the challenge of guests at a remote venue with no internet being able to all upload their photos at the event site to a central location. Both Android and iOS have to be supported, otherwise something like AirDrop would be used if it was just iOS.

More details will be added in future MergeRequests as to the intention of this project and it's use case, and this readme will be updated.

# Snapdrop 

[Snapdrop](https://snapdrop.net): local file sharing in your browser. Inspired by Apple's Airdrop.


#### Snapdrop is built with the following awesome technologies:
* Vanilla HTML5 / ES6 / CSS3 frontend
* [WebRTC](http://webrtc.org/) / [WebSockets](http://www.websocket.org/)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) backend
* [Progressive Web App](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Web_App)

You can [host your own instance with Docker](/docs/local-dev.md).
